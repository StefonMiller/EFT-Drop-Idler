# EFT-Drop-Idler
This is a Chrome Extension that idles for Escape From Tarkov Twitch Drops for the June 2020 Twitch drops event. The extension itself was made in ~4 hours. There are many things I would change if I had the time, however the event was announced with such short notice development took place hours before the drops started and was actively worked on throughout the event.

The extension itself gets a list of the top 100 streamers currently broadcasting EFT using Twitch API. From there we cross reference that list with a static list of streamers that have drops enabled for a given day, which was released by Battlestate Games prior to the event. The streamer that has drops enabled with the most viewers is selected and that stream is opened in a new tab. This routine executes every 30 minutes and only opens a new tab if there is not stream with drops enabled opened to prevent creating a new tab every 30 mins. For this event, the streams with drops enabled switched at 12:00 MSK, so I had to convert timezones to switch streams at the correct times.
